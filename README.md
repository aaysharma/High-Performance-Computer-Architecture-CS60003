# High-Performance-Computer-Architecture-CS60003-Assignment-1
gem5 can simulate CPUs with different configurations (e.g. number of cores, pipeline complexity, cache size...) based on configuration scripts. We write a sample configuration script and configure it to an Out-Of-Order CPU with a list of the microarchitectural parameters (provided in detailed pdf) that reflects the characteristic of a single-core x86 processor and run the provided benchmark program. We analyse the output statistics of each of these config combinations to select top 10 combinations and finally share our observations alongwith explainations.

# High-Performance-Computer-Architecture-CS60003-Assignment-1
gem5 can simulate CPUs with different configurations (e.g. number of cores, pipeline complexity, cache size...) based on configuration scripts. How to write a sample configuration script has been shown in the tutorial (video available on course webpage). In this assignment, your task is to configure an Out-Of-Order CPU with a list of the microarchitectural parameters (provided below) that reflects the characteristic of a single-core x86 processor and run the provided benchmark program. More precisely, you will have to create different configuration combinations based on the parameters and their values mentioned in this document and run the provided benchmark program using those scripts. Then you will analyse the output statistics of each of these config combinations to select top 10 combinations and finally answer the questions mentioned in the later part of the document.
